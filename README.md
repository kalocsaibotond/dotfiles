# My Personal Dotfiles

My personal chezmoi managed dotfiles. They are subject to breaking changes.

I aim to construct a modern cross-platform unix-style terminal workflow that supports windows and linux,
yet integrates neatly into the respective ecosystems.

For windows I work with PowersShell 7, meanwhile on linux I intend to work with bash,
preferably with dash. Due to the linux - windows incompatibilities, the specific tools
and their configuration might differ, but I intend to keep the workflow a unified as possilbe

The source of my inspiration is [Unix as IDE](https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/) .

I am a beginner terminal-tor, so feel free to give me advice, recommended tools and configs.
The dotfiles are work-in-progress. I build the linux part later.
